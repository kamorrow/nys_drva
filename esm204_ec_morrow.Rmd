### BACKGROUND

In `r data$year[4]` New York State's deer population following the hunting season was estimated to be `r as.character(data$deer_pop[4])`. Reportable animal-vehicle crashes totaled `r data$av_crashes[4]` that year, `r data$pct[4]`% of all crashes in New York State, excluding New York City.
(Reportable crashes are those resulting in death, personal injury, or more than \$1,000 in property damage.)
By `r data$year[16]` the deer population had grown to `r as.character(data$deer_pop[16])` individuals (a `r round(((data$deer_pop[16] - data$deer_pop[4])/data$deer_pop[4])*100, 2)`% change),  while reportable crashes had ballooned to `r data$av_crashes[16]`, a `r round(((data$av_crashes[16] - data$av_crashes[4])/data$av_crashes[4])*100, 2)`% change.
Animal-vehicles crashes accounted for `r data$pct[16]`% of all reportable crashes in `r data$year[16]`. (Figure 1, ISU DVCIR)
